LOcal repository == the code or file which is created in our cumputer
Remote repository == the code which is crated by us  in server of github
 why to use git  ? 
 
 
 basically first if we create free fire version 1 then we u[date it to 2
 git will help us to see what changes we made by clicking on commit 
 we can also work on pfree fire verseion 1 if we dont like version2




BRANCG if we in branch we will cam crate copyof master and cAN ADd features to copy
