LOcal repository == the code or file which is created in our cumputer
Remote repository == the code which is crated by us  in server of github
 why to use git  ? 
 
 
 basically first if we create free fire version 1 then we u[date it to 2
 git will help us to see what changes we made by clicking on commit 
 we can also work on pfree fire verseion 1 if we dont like version2



BRANCHING 

after branching we will create a copy and then where we cah add some features if we like the features then we
can also merge it with main

while we make some changes in branch it will not be added in main branch
